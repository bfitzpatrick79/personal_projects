Currently working towards a model predicting wins and losses for the NFL.

'bear_data_get_test.ipynb' was my test bed for scraping and cleaning the data

'general_data_ingest.ipynb' is the program that ingests all the data from the source. It outputs a set of 32 dataframes as an excel file for each team in the data folder.
It further outputs an excel file for the full set of data combined into one frame.

Data is being scraped from https://www.pro-football-reference.com/

TO DO is over in the projects tab
